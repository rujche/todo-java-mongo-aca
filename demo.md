# Demo of Java Enhancement for azd 

## 0. Intro 

I am excited to introduce the recent enhancements we have made to the `azd` tool.

## 1. azdâ€™s current experience of current existing project and recap its key problem 

Let's start with an existing project about todo project. Here is the system diagram of the todo project:

The todo project contains 3 components: 

   1. web is the frontend application.
   2. api is the backend application.
   3. PostgreSQL is the database used to store the todo items.

Let's start by running `azd init` in this repository. Pain points:

   1. Customer need to write bicep file for PostgreSQL.
   2. Customer need to consider how to pass backend application's end point to frontend application.

## 2. Show azd Enhancement for Java experience for the same project 

Now, let's move on to the Java enhancements we have made to azd. We will use `azd init` to generate the improved 
azure.yaml. This new format of azure.yaml describes the services, the service bindings, and the Azure resources. After 
that, we will call `azd up` to provision the resources and deploy the services.

Steps: 

   1. Run `azd init` to generate the azure.yaml.
   2. Show and explain azure.yaml.
      1. The services.
      2. The service bindings.
      3. The Azure resources.
   3. Run `azd up`. Confirm the application work well in the cloud.

## 3. Show it for new project as well

Next, we will demonstrate the ability on a newly created project. We will use VS Code to create a new Java project and 
use the Spring Initializr to select web and Service Bus dependencies. Then, we will run `azd init` and `azd up`. Here 
is the diagram of the new project:

Steps:

   1. VS code -> Java: new project -> Spring boot -> selected dependencies (web app with service bus)
   2. Run `azd init` & `azd up`.

## 4. Recap its advantage

To wrap up, the enhancements to the `azd` tool significantly streamline the process of analyzing, provisioning, and 
deploying Java applications to Azure.

|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Detection | Make sure required Azure Service (like Azure Database for PostgreSQL) can be **detected** by analyzing project files (like pom.xml, application.yml, Java codes).            | 
| Provision | Make sure required Azure service be **provisioned**.                                                                                                                         | 
| Usage     | Make sure required Azure service (like Azure Database for PostgreSQL) can be **used** (connected) in customer's app deployed in compute service (like Azure Container Apps). | 

These improvements save time, reduce complexity, and ensure a more efficient workflow. Thank you for watching, and I 
look forward to seeing how you leverage these enhancements in your projects.
